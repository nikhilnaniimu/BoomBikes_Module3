## General Information
This project is done for the US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes wherein they recently suffered a dip in revenues due to the ongoing pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. 
So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 
They have contracted to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:
Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
How well those variables describe the bike demands
Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors. 

## Technologies Used

numpy
pandas
sklearn
matplotlib
seaborn
statsmodel

## Conclusions
Year, temperature and light were found to be the top 3 features explaining the demand by looking at their coefficients. The final model explains 84% of the demand.
